# COMPAS_V4641-Sgr_simulations
This respisotry will contain all COMPAS simulations directly related to the V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) intermediate-mass x-ray binary (IMXB)
More information on V4641 Sgr (links provided) below:
[AAVSO V4641 Sgr](https://www.aavso.org/vsots_v4641sgr)
[SIMBAD  V4641 Sgr](https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=V4641+Sgr)

We are using the COMPAS publicly available software to simulate IMXB systems similar to V4641 Sgr in order to better understand the formation pathways of low-mass x-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the Milky Way galaxy (MW)
